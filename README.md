This repository contains (most) of the reusable workflows under the `feature/reusable-workflows` branch and utility mergeable branches under `feature/mergeable/*`.

These 'mergeable' features are available through an automatic install (and update) workflow via this repository (or any repo with the manuals as they can run on remote and local) `feature/mergeable/manual-workflows` under the actions tab.

And clicking the `Run Workflow` button and entering your repo information to install remotely (the default ~ installs to the repo the workflow is running on).

### Alternative Local Solution

First add a new remote named `something`:

`git remote add something https://github.com/RedEyeMods/.github.git`

and fetching it:

`git fetch something`

Mergeable branches can be force merged initially into repos by adding a remote and then merging of `something/feature/mergeable/xyz` with `--allow-unrelated-histories`. Further merges need no extra tag since the history is now related.

`git merge something/feature/mergeable/xyz [--allow-unrelated-histories]`
